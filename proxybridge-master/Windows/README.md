   **Action:**
   - **PROXY** - Route through configured proxy
   - **DIRECT** - Allow direct internet access
   - **BLOCK** - Block all internet access

4. Click **Save Rule** to apply the configuration

#### Exporting and Importing Rules

ProxyBridge allows you to export selected rules to a JSON file and import rules from previously exported files, making it easy to share configurations between systems or back up your rule sets.

**Export Rules:**
1. In the **Proxy Rules** window, select one or more rules using the checkboxes in the **Select** column
2. Click the **Select All** button to select all rules (optional)
3. Click the **Export** button (only enabled when at least one rule is selected)
4. Choose a location and save the JSON file

**Import Rules:**
1. Click the **Import** button
2. Select a previously exported JSON file
3. Rules will be imported and added to your existing rules

**JSON Format Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "processNames": "chrome.exe",
    "targetHosts": "*",
    "targetPorts": "*",
    "protocol": "TCP",
    "action": "PROXY",
    "enabled": true
  },
  {
    "processNames": "firefox.exe",
    "targetHosts": "192.168.*.*",
    "targetPorts": "80;443",
    "protocol": "BOTH",
    "action": "DIRECT",
    "enabled": true
  }
]
```

**Note:** The JSON format is compatible across platforms, allowing you to export rules from macOS and import them on Windows, and vice versa.

#### Activity Monitoring

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/ProxyBridge.png" alt="Active Connections" width="600"/>
</p>

- View real-time connection activity in the **Connections** tab
- Monitor all system connections including both TCP and UDP protocols
- See connections from all processes, whether they match rules or not
- Track which processes are active and their routing status (PROXY, DIRECT, or BLOCK)
- Search and filter connections using the search box


**Note:** Adding a rule with action **PROXY** while no proxy is configured will result in traffic being routed through a direct connection instead. Make sure to configure proxy settings before using PROXY rules.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI provides powerful automation and scripting capabilities with rule-based traffic control:

#### Basic Usage
```powershell
# Help menu
ProxyBridge_CLI -h

# Use custom HTTP proxy
ProxyBridge_CLI --proxy http://192.168.1.100:8080

# Route Chrome through socks5 proxy
ProxyBridge_CLI --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 --rule "chrome.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY"

# Route multiple processes in single rule (semicolon-separated)
ProxyBridge_CLI --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 --rule "chrome.exe;steam*.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY"

# Multiple rules with verbose connection logging
ProxyBridge_CLI --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 --rule "chrome.exe;steam*.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY" --rule "firefox.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY" --verbose 2

# Block specific application from internet access
ProxyBridge_CLI --rule "malware.exe:*:*:BOTH:BLOCK"

# Route specific apps through proxy, block everything else
ProxyBridge_CLI --rule "chrome.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY" --rule "firefox.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY" --rule "*:*:*:BOTH:BLOCK"

# Route all through proxy except proxy app itself
ProxyBridge_CLI --rule "*:*:*:TCP:PROXY" --rule "BurpSuiteCommunity.exe:*:*:TCP:DIRECT"

# Target specific IPs and ports
ProxyBridge_CLI --rule "chrome.exe:192.168.*.*;10.10.*.*:80;443;8080:TCP:PROXY"

# Import rules from JSON file
ProxyBridge_CLI --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 --rule-file C:\rules.json

#### Rule Format

**Format:** `process:hosts:ports:protocol:action`

- **process** - Process name(s): `chrome.exe`, `chrome.exe;firefox.exe`, `steam*.exe`, or `*`
- **hosts** - Target IP/hostname(s): `*`, `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.*.*`, `10.10.1.1-10.10.255.255`, or `192.168.1.1;10.10.10.10`
- **ports** - Target port(s): `*`, `443`, `80;443;8080`, `80-8000`, or `80;443;8000-9000`
- **protocol** - `TCP`, `UDP`, or `BOTH`
- **action** - `PROXY`, `DIRECT`, or `BLOCK`

**Examples:**
```powershell
# Single process to proxy
--rule "chrome.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY"

# Multiple processes in one rule
--rule "chrome.exe;firefox.exe;steam*.exe:*:*:TCP:PROXY"

# Target specific IPs and ports
--rule "chrome.exe:192.168.*;10.10.*.*:80;443;8080:TCP:PROXY"

# Allow direct connection (bypass proxy)
--rule "BurpSuiteCommunity.exe:*:*:TCP:DIRECT"

--rule-file "C:\proxybridge-rule.json"
```

**Notes:**
- After installation, the CLI is available from any terminal (no `.\` prefix needed)
- Process names are case-insensitive
- Use `*` as the process name to set a default action for all traffic
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop ProxyBridge

## Use Cases

- Redirect proxy-unaware applications (games, desktop apps) through InterceptSuite/Burp Suite for security testing
- Route specific applications through Tor,SOCKS5 or HTTP proxies
- Intercept and analyze traffic from applications that don't support proxy configuration
- Test application behavior under different network conditions
- Analyze protocols and communication patterns



## Current Limitations

- IPv4 only (IPv6 not supported)

## Things to Note

- **DNS Traffic Handling**: DNS traffic on TCP and UDP port 53 is handled separately from proxy rules. Even if you configure rules for port 53, they will be ignored. Instead, DNS routing is controlled by the **DNS via Proxy** option in the Proxy menu (enabled by default). When enabled, all DNS queries are routed through the proxy; when disabled, DNS queries use direct connection.

- **Localhost Traffic Handling**: Localhost traffic (127.0.0.0/8) requires special handling and is controlled by the **Localhost via Proxy** option in the Proxy menu (disabled by default):

  **Default Behavior (Localhost via Proxy = Disabled):**
  - ALL localhost traffic automatically uses direct connection
  - Proxy rules matching 127.x.x.x addresses are automatically overridden to DIRECT
  - This is the recommended setting for most users

  **Why localhost should stay local:**
  - **Security**: Most proxy servers reject localhost traffic to prevent SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks
  - **Compatibility**: Many applications run local services that must stay on your machine:
    - NVIDIA GeForce Experience (local API servers)
    - Chrome/Edge DevTools (127.0.0.1:9222 debugging protocol)
    - Development servers (localhost web/database servers)
    - Inter-process communication (IPC) using TCP/UDP on 127.0.0.1
  - **Routing Issues**: When localhost traffic goes to a remote proxy:
    - The proxy server cannot reach services running on YOUR machine
    - Applications expecting local responses will timeout or fail
    - Example: `curl http://127.0.0.1:8080` via remote proxy asks the proxy's localhost, not yours

  **When to Enable Localhost via Proxy:**
  - ✅ Proxy server is running on the same machine (127.0.0.1:1080)
  - ✅ Security testing: Intercepting localhost traffic in Burp Suite/InterceptSuite
  - ✅ Your proxy is configured to handle localhost requests properly
  - ❌ Do NOT enable if proxy is on a different machine/IP address

  **CLI/GUI Options:**
  - GUI: **Proxy** menu → **Localhost via Proxy** (checkbox)
  - CLI: `--localhost-via-proxy` flag

- **Automatic Direct Routing**: Certain IP addresses and ports automatically use direct connection regardless of proxy rules, though you can still create rules with **DIRECT** (default) or **BLOCK** actions for them:
  - **Broadcast addresses** (255.255.255.255 and x.x.x.255) - Network broadcast
  - **Multicast addresses** (224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255) - Group communication
  - **APIPA addresses** (169.254.0.0/16) - Automatic Private IP Addressing (link-local)
  - **DHCP ports** (UDP 67, 68) - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

  These addresses and ports are used by system components, network discovery, and essential Windows services. While proxy rules are automatically overridden to DIRECT for these targets, you can still define rules with DIRECT or BLOCK actions to explicitly control or block this traffic.

- **UDP Proxy Requirements**: UDP traffic only works when a SOCKS5 proxy is configured. If an HTTP proxy server is configured, ProxyBridge will ignore UDP proxy rules and route UDP traffic as direct connection instead. This limitation does not affect UDP rules with BLOCK or DIRECT actions.

  **Important UDP Considerations**:
  - Configuring a SOCKS5 proxy does not guarantee UDP will work. Most SOCKS5 proxies do not support UDP traffic, including SSH SOCKS5 proxies.
  - The SOCKS5 proxy must support UDP ASSOCIATE command. If ProxyBridge fails to establish a UDP association with the SOCKS5 proxy, packets will fail to connect.
  - Many UDP applications use HTTP/3 and DTLS protocols. Even if your SOCKS5 proxy supports UDP ASSOCIATE, ensure it can handle DTLS and HTTP/3 UDP traffic, as they require separate handling beyond raw UDP packets.
  - **Testing UDP/HTTP3/DTLS Support**: If you need to test UDP, HTTP/3, and DTLS support with a SOCKS5 proxy, try [Nexus Proxy](https://github.com/InterceptSuite/nexus-proxy) - a proxy application created specifically to test ProxyBridge with advanced UDP protocols.

## How It Works

ProxyBridge use Windivert to inspect all TCP/UDP packets and use rules from user to perform action on them

Case 1: Packet does not match any rules

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/flow1.png" alt="flow" width="600"/>
</p>


Case 2: Packet match with proxy rule


<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/flow.png" alt="flow" width="600"/>
</p>

**Traffic Flow:**
1. **Applications Generate Traffic** - User-mode applications (Chrome, Discord, Games, Services) create TCP/UDP packets
2. **Kernel Interception** - WinDivert.sys driver intercepts ALL outbound packets at kernel level
3. **User-Mode Delivery** - WinDivert.dll receives intercepted packets and delivers them to ProxyBridge
4. **Rule Evaluation** - ProxyBridge inspects each packet and applies configured rules:
   - **BLOCK** → Packet is dropped (no network access)
   - **DIRECT** → Packet is re-injected unchanged (direct connection)
   - **NO MATCH** → Packet is re-injected unchanged (direct connection)
   - **PROXY** → Packet destination is modified to TCP/UDP relay servers (34010/34011)
5. **Proxy Processing** - For PROXY-matched packets:
   - Relay servers store original destination IP and port
   - Convert raw TCP/UDP to SOCKS5/HTTP proxy protocol
   - Perform proxy authentication and forward to proxy server
6. **Proxy Forwarding** - Proxy server (Burp Suite/InterceptSuite) forwards traffic to original destination
7. **Response Handling** - Return traffic flows back through relay servers, which restore original source IP/port before re-injection

**Key Points:**
- All packet manipulation happens transparently - applications remain completely unaware
- WinDivert operates at kernel level for reliable interception before packets reach the network
- ProxyBridge rule engine provides granular control over which traffic gets proxied
- TCP/UDP relay servers handle protocol conversion between raw sockets and proxy protocols


## Build from Source
